## Welcome to EXC ##

EXC is a no frills, no fad, lets just get some work done framework to build your web applications with JavaScript and PHP.

Creating web apps with EXC is meant to be simple, something that you can pickup and learn quickly. We put a lot of effort into making a framework for modern web apps that is simple and lightweight.

EXC includes a **Server Side Framework** that runs on PHP and the **Client Side Framework** that runs on JS. Both loosely couple yet fully integrated.

EXC is meant to be compatible with most hosting services that run PHP without requiring any fancy setups or scaffolding. You do not even need a hosting service with access to the command line.
